I’m Jinxiong You, and you might know me as Eugene.\n\n\n\nOne Community Global   May 2024 – Present\nSoftware Engineer\nBosch Engineering GmbH   Dec 2021 – Jun 2022\nSoftware Engineer Intern\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, Udacity May 2024-Jul 2024\n\nDeveloped a Flask-based RESTful API to manage the coffee shop’s menu and user data, using SQLAlchemy for database interactions with PostgreSQL.\nImplemented endpoints for CRUD operations and handled data migrations.\nIntegrated Auth0 for secure user authentication and authorization. Implemented role-based access control to assign different permissions for public users, baristas, and managers, ensuring secure access to various features.\nDeployed the application on AWS, utilizing EC2 for server hosting, RDS for PostgreSQL database management, and S3 for static asset storage.\n\nConfigured AWS Lambda for serverless functions to handle background tasks, enhancing scalability and performance.\n\nReal-World Algorithms for IoT Implementation Jan 2023-May 2023\n\nDeveloped data visualization for phone accelerometer readings and implemented pedestrian dead-reckoning using accelerometer and gyroscope data for 3D orientation tracking.\nApplied DUET algorithms to separate mixed voice signals from microphone inputs and used delay-and-sum techniques to determine the angle of arrival of voices in a microphone array.\nUtilized dynamic time warping to identify and reconstruct missing windows of ECG data from a smartwatch.\n\n[Restaurant Rating Web Platform (Java Full Stack)] Aug 2022 – Dec 2022\n\nConstructed a database structure including restaurants, dishes, prices, ratings and reviews, based on PostgreSQL.\nCreated backend REST APIs framework by Spring Boot and establish connection with database by mybatis, react.js as frontend.\nEmployed advanced SQL queries and utilized transactions to ensure concurrency control and data integrity.\n\n[Lung Cancer Diagnosis and Nodule Prediction System] Jun 2021 – Aug 2021\n\nSet up and deployed a deep neural network on Google Cloud for nodule detection in 3-D CT scan images, including training and deployment of the model.\nDesigned and implemented an application using Spring Cloud with a separate frontend and backend, providing administrators with access to backend data and dictionaries, and clients with login and account management functionalities.\nProduced a paper based on the work and was accepted by IYSF Conference.\n\n[Mathematical Contest in Modeling, Team Captain] Feb 2021\n\nOrganized techniques of research and delegate responsibility with team members.\nAnalyzed the probability of hornet appearance on Vancouver Island with Bayesian model, decision tree, based on dataset of appearance coordinates. Utilized feature recognition to analyze the images of hornets, in order to identify their validity.\nWrote paper as a report of our technique to address the problem, was awarded as Honorable Mention.\n\n\n\n\n\nNodules detection by deep convolutional neural network and its application\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of British Columbia Aug 2024 – Jun 2025\nMaster of Data Science\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Aug 2022 – Dec 2023\nMaster of Engineering in Electric & Computer Engineering\nSoochow University, China Sep 2018 – Jun 2022\nBachelor of Engineering in Computer Science"
